USBCMD—USB Command Register
I/O Offset: Base + (00h–01h) Attribute: R/W
Default Value: 0000h Size: 16 bits
The Command Register indicates the command to be executed by the serial bus host
controller. Writing to the register causes a command to be executed. The table
following the bit description provides additional information on the operation of the
Run/Stop and Debug bits.
Bit Description
15:7 Reserved
8
Loop Back Test Mode — R/W.
0 = Disable loop back test mode.
1 = Intel® ICH7 is in loop back test mode. When both ports are connected together, a
write to one port will be seen on the other port and the data will be stored in I/O
offset 18h.
7
Max Packet (MAXP) — R/W. This bit selects the maximum packet size that can be
used for full speed bandwidth reclamation at the end of a frame. This value is used by
the host controller to determine whether it should initiate another transaction based on
the time remaining in the SOF counter. Use of reclamation packets larger than the
programmed size will cause a Babble error if executed during the critical window at
frame end. The Babble error results in the offending endpoint being stalled. Software is
responsible for ensuring that any packet which could be executed under bandwidth
reclamation be within this size limit.
0 = 32 bytes
1 = 64 bytes
6
Configure Flag (CF) — R/W. This bit has no effect on the hardware. It is provided only
as a semaphore service for software.
0 = Indicates that software has not completed host controller configuration.
1 = HCD software sets this bit as the last action in its process of configuring the host
controller.
5
Software Debug (SWDBG) — R/W. The SWDBG bit must only be manipulated when
the controller is in the stopped state. This can be determined by checking the HCHalted
bit in the USBSTS register.
0 = Normal Mode.
1 = Debug mode. In SW Debug mode, the host controller clears the Run/Stop bit after
the completion of each USB transaction. The next transaction is executed when
software sets the Run/Stop bit back to 1.
4
Force Global Resume (FGR) — R/W.
0 = Software resets this bit to 0 after 20 ms has elapsed to stop sending the Global
Resume signal. At that time all USB devices should be ready for bus activity. The 1
to 0 transition causes the port to send a low speed EOP signal. This bit will remain
a 1 until the EOP has completed.
1 = Host controller sends the Global Resume signal on the USB, and sets this bit to 1
when a resume event (connect, disconnect, or K-state) is detected while in global
suspend mode

Enter Global Suspend Mode (EGSM) — R/W.
0 = Software resets this bit to 0 to come out of Global Suspend mode. Software writes
this bit to 0 at the same time that Force Global Resume (bit 4) is written to 0 or
after writing bit 4 to 0.
1 = Host controller enters the Global Suspend mode. No USB transactions occur during
this time. The Host controller is able to receive resume signals from USB and
interrupt the system. Software must ensure that the Run/Stop bit (bit 0) is cleared
prior to setting this bit.
2
Global Reset (GRESET) — R/W.
0 = This bit is reset by the software after a minimum of 10 ms has elapsed as specified
in Chapter 7 of the USB Specification.
1 = Global Reset. The host controller sends the global reset signal on the USB and then
resets all its logic, including the internal hub registers. The hub registers are reset
to their power on state. Chip Hardware Reset has the same effect as Global Reset
(bit 2), except that the host controller does not send the Global Reset on USB.
1
Host Controller Reset (HCRESET) — R/W. The effects of HCRESET on Hub registers
are slightly different from Chip Hardware Reset and Global USB Reset. The HCRESET
affects bits [8,3:0] of the Port Status and Control Register (PORTSC) of each port.
HCRESET resets the state machines of the host controller including the Connect/
Disconnect state machine (one for each port). When the Connect/Disconnect state
machine is reset, the output that signals connect/disconnect are negated to 0,
effectively signaling a disconnect, even if a device is attached to the port. This virtual
disconnect causes the port to be disabled. This disconnect and disabling of the port
causes bit 1 (connect status change) and bit 3 (port enable/disable change) of the
PORTSC (D29:F0/F1/F2/F3:BASE + 10h) to get set. The disconnect also causes bit 8 of
PORTSC to reset. About 64 bit times after HCRESET goes to 0, the connect and lowspeed
detect will take place, and bits 0 and 8 of the PORTSC will change accordingly.
0 = Reset by the host controller when the reset process is complete.
1 = Reset. When this bit is set, the host controller module resets its internal timers,
counters, state machines, etc. to their initial value. Any transaction currently in
progress on USB is immediately terminated.
0
Run/Stop (RS) — R/W. When set to 1, the ICH7 proceeds with execution of the
schedule. The ICH7 continues execution as long as this bit is set. When this bit is
cleared, the ICH7 completes the current transaction on the USB and then halts. The HC
Halted bit in the status register indicates when the host controller has finished the
transaction and has entered the stopped state. The host controller clears this bit when
the following fatal errors occur: consistency check failure, PCI Bus errors.
0 = Stop
1 = Run
NOTE: This bit should only be cleared if there are no active Transaction Descriptors in
the executable schedule or software will reset the host controller prior to setting
this bit again.


USBSTS—USB Status Register
I/O Offset: Base + (02h–03h) Attribute: R/WC
Default Value: 0020h Size: 16 bits
This register indicates pending interrupts and various states of the host controller. The
status resulting from a transaction on the serial bus is not indicated in this register.
Bit Description
15:6 Reserved
5
HCHalted — R/WC.
0 = Software clears this bit by writing a 1 to it.
1 = The host controller has stopped executing as a result of the Run/Stop bit being set
to 0, either by software or by the host controller hardware (debug mode or an
internal error). Default.
4
Host Controller Process Error — R/WC.
0 = Software clears this bit by writing a 1 to it.
1 = The host controller has detected a fatal error. This indicates that the host controller
suffered a consistency check failure while processing a Transfer Descriptor. An
example of a consistency check failure would be finding an invalid PID field while
processing the packet header portion of the TD. When this error occurs, the host
controller clears the Run/Stop bit in the Command register (D29:F0/F1/F2/
F3:BASE + 00h, bit 0) to prevent further schedule execution. A hardware interrupt
is generated to the system.
3
Host System Error — R/WC.
0 = Software clears this bit by writing a 1 to it.
1 = A serious error occurred during a host system access involving the host controller
module. In a PCI system, conditions that set this bit to 1 include PCI Parity error,
PCI Master Abort, and PCI Target Abort. When this error occurs, the host controller
clears the Run/Stop bit in the Command register to prevent further execution of
the scheduled TDs. A hardware interrupt is generated to the system.
2
Resume Detect (RSM_DET) — R/WC.
0 = Software clears this bit by writing a 1 to it.
1 = The host controller received a “RESUME” signal from a USB device. This is only
valid if the Host controller is in a global suspend state (Command register, D29:F0/
F1/F2/F3:BASE + 00h, bit 3 = 1).
1
USB Error Interrupt — R/WC.
0 = Software clears this bit by writing a 1 to it.
1 = Completion of a USB transaction resulted in an error condition (e.g., error counter
underflow). If the TD on which the error interrupt occurred also had its IOC bit
(D29:F0/F1/F2/F3:BASE + 04h, bit 2) set, both this bit and Bit 0 are set.
0
USB Interrupt (USBINT) — R/WC.
0 = Software clears this bit by writing a 1 to it.
1 = The host controller sets this bit when the cause of an interrupt is a completion of a
USB transaction whose Transfer Descriptor had its IOC bit set. Also set when a
short packet is detected (actual length field in TD is less than maximum length field
in TD), and short packet detection is enabled in that TD.
