Welcome to the f-os readme!

Minimal is minimal wordset of forth system. This is system baremetal, loading from MBR. It working in flat PM 32 mode.  Filesystem very simpe based on 8192 bytes blocks, numbering 1 - 2^32-1. Block 0 mbr and kernel, further loading going from source code located in blocks 1 - 2^32-1.

Kernel calls 1 LOAD word, where (in 1st block) present other LOADs.

In this version of Forth numbers enters with spcecial words 0x (zero exs) 0xd (zero exs di) for only hexadecimal unsigned numbers single (32 bits) and double (64 bits) precision. 


FORTH32  - base vocabulary.
BADWORD - vector word with zero Link Field. End of search on vocabulary in wich BADWORD is. By default poits to ABORT.
EXIT - exit. End of interpretation. 
       This two words present in any vocabulary.
Push - push data on stack.
Pop - pop data from stack.
ABORT - message wrong word. Called by BADWORD.
HERE - top of codofile. Above HERE  free memory.

INTERPRET - interpretator.
PARSE - take word form input stream and place it to HERE as zero by 4 aligned string with counter.
CONTEXT - variable where lays vocid of searching vocabulary.
CURRENT - variable where lays vocid of appending vocabulary.
ENCLOSE - transfer string form addra to addrb, setting counter and zero aligning it. If at addra empty place to addrb  EXIT word.
@  - fetch. 
SFIND - finds word from HERE in CONTEXT from stack and put xt of this word to stack.
EXECUTE - execute xt from top of stack.
BLOCK - variable-defined word,  puts on stack address of block structure.
variable# - constant. Points to code for VARIABLE-defined words.
constant# - constant. Points to code for CONSTANT-defined words.
>IN    - variable. Counts symbols in input stream.

ASSEMBLER - vocabulary for opcodes by default based on FORTH32
